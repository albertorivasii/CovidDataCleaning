# Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Data
## Skills Used: SQL(Window Functions, View Creation, CTE Creation, Temp Table Creation)
### Data From: [Our World in Data COVID-19 World Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
Personal Project exploring COVID-19 death and vaccination rates by country and continent.  Mainly exploratory in nature and was to prepare for Tableau dashboard I published [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alberto.rivas.ii).  Created Two views to analyuze further in Tableau:
1. Rolling vaccination counts by country, daily
2. Rolling death toll by country, daily

Goal was to try and visualize the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and the death rate of any given country.

## Possibilities for Improvement
- Fill Null Values in SQL to have one less step for Tableau analysis
- Explore other data comparison options such as GDP/capita and its relation to COVID-19 Deaths
- Create a view that creates vaccination and death rates on a per capita basis
